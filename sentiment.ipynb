       " Document(page_content=\"Norfolk Southern has agreed to pay $600 million in a class-action lawsuit settlement for a fiery February 2023 train derailment in Ohio, but residents worry the money not only won’t go far enough to cover future health needs that could be tremendous but also won't amount to much once divvied up.\\n\\n“It’s not nowhere near my needs, let alone what the health effects are going to be five or 10 years down the road,” said Eric Cozza, who lived just three blocks from the derailment and had 47 family members living within a mile (1.61 kilometers).\\n\\nMore than three dozen of the freight train's 149 cars derailed on the outskirts of East Palestine, a town of almost 5,000 residents near the Pennsylvania state line. Several cars spilled a cocktail of hazardous materials that caught fire. Three days later, officials, fearing an explosion, blew open five tankcars filled with vinyl chloride and burned the toxic chemical — sending thick, black plumes of smoke into the air. Some 1,500 to 2,000 residents were evacuated.\\n\\nNorfolk Southern said the agreement, if approved by the court, will resolve all class action claims within a 20-mile (32-kilometer) radius of the derailment and, for residents who choose to participate, personal injury claims within a 10-mile (16-kilometer) radius of the derailment.\\n\\nADVERTISEMENT\\n\\nThe area includes East Palestine and people who evacuated, as well as several other larger towns.\\n\\nThe settlement, which doesn’t include or constitute any admission of liability, wrongdoing or fault, represents only a small slice of the $3 billion in revenue Norfolk Southern generated just in the first three months of this year. The railroad said that even after the settlement it still made a $213 million profit in the quarter.\\n\\nEast Palestine resident Krissy Ferguson called the settlement a “heart-wrenching day.”\\n\\n“I just feel like we’ve been victimized over and over and over again,” she said. “We fought and we’re still fighting. And contamination is still flowing down the creeks. People are still sick. And I think people that had the power to fight took an easy way out.”\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nMore than a year later residents still complain about respiratory problems and unexplained rashes and nosebleeds, but the greater fear is that people will develop cancer or other serious conditions because of the chemicals they were exposed to. Researchers have only begun to work on determining the lasting repercussions of the derailment.\\n\\nThe company said Tuesday that individuals and businesses will be able to use compensation from the settlement in any manner they see fit.\\n\\nThe settlement is expected to be submitted for preliminary approval to the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Ohio this month. Payments could begin to arrive by the end of the year, subject to final court approval.\\n\\nNorfolk Southern has already spent more than $1.1 billion on its response to the derailment, including more than $104 million in direct aid to East Palestine and its residents. Partly because Norfolk Southern is paying for the cleanup, President Joe Biden has never declared a disaster in the town, which remains a sore point for many.\\n\\nThe railroad has promised to create a fund to help pay for the long-term health needs of the community, but that hasn’t been finalized yet.\\n\\nThe plaintiffs' attorneys said the deal follows a year of intense investigation and should provide meaningful relief to residents.\\n\\nStill, residents like Misti Allison have many unanswered questions.\\n\\n“What goes through my head is, after all the lawyers are paid and the legal fees are accounted for, how much funding will be provided for families? And is that going to be enough for any of these potential damages moving forward?” she said.\\n\\nJami Wallace, too, worries about having a settlement without knowing the long-term impact of the derailment.\\n\\n“I would really like to see the numbers because in my opinion, taking a plea deal only is in the best interest of the attorneys,” she said. “They’re all going to get their money. But we’re the residents that are still going to be left to suffer.”\\n\\nCozza said he spent about $8,000 to move out of town and that — along with medical bills and the cost of replacing his contaminated belongings — exhausted what little savings he had. And he can't put a price on the 10-year relationship he lost or the way his extended family was scattered after the derailment.\\n\\nThe CEO of Threshold Residential, one of the biggest employers in town, estimates that his business has lost well over $100,000.\\n\\nLast week federal officials said that the aftermath of the train derailment doesn’t qualify as a public health emergency because widespread health problems and ongoing chemical exposure haven’t been documented, contrasting residents' reports.\\n\\nThe head of the National Transportation Safety Board recently said the agency’s investigation showed that venting and burning of the vinyl chloride was unnecessary because the producer of the chemical ascertained that no dangerous reaction occurred inside the tank cars. Officials who made the decision — Ohio’s governor and the local fire chief leading the response — have said they were never told that.\\n\\nThe NTSB’s full investigation into the cause of the derailment won’t be complete until June, but the agency has said that an overheating wheel bearing on one of the railcars, which wasn’t detected in time by a trackside sensor, likely caused the crash.\\n\\nThe EPA has said cleanup in East Palestine is expected to be completed this year.\\n\\nThe railroad announced preliminary first-quarter earnings of 23 cents per share Tuesday, which reflects the cost of the $600 million settlement. Without the settlement and some other one-time costs, the railroad said it would have made $2.39 per share.\\n\\nRailroad CEO Alan Shaw, who is fighting for his job against an activist investor aiming to overhaul the railroad's operations, said Norfolk Southern is “becoming a more productive and efficient railroad” but acknowledged there is more work to do.\\n\\nAncora Holdings is trying to persuade investors to support its nominees for Norfolk Southern's board and its plan to replace Shaw and the rest of the management team at the railroad's May 9 annual meeting. Ancora says the company's profits have lagged behind the other major freight railroads for years and the investors question Shaw's leadership.\\n\\nThe railroad said that in addition to the settlement, its results were hurt by $91 million in unusual expenses including money it is spending to fight back against Ancora, management layoffs and the $25 million it gave to CPKC last month for the right to hire one of that railroad's executives to be Norfolk Southern's new chief operating officer.\\n\\nThe railroad said Tuesday that even though volume was up 4% during the first quarter, company revenue fell by 4% because of lower fuel surcharge revenue and changes in the mix of shipments it handled to include more containers of imported goods that railroads get paid less to deliver than other commodities.\\n\\nShares of Norfolk Southern Corp., based in Atlanta, were up slightly through the day after a flat start following the settlement announcement.\\n\\n___\\n\\nAssociated Press writer Brooke Schultz contributed to this report from Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, and Michelle Chapman contributed from New York.\\n\\nJosh Funk, The Associated Press\", metadata={'title': 'Norfolk Southern agrees to $600M settlement in fiery Ohio derailment.

       " Document(page_content='(Bloomberg) -- Boeing Co. faces a deepening crisis of confidence after an engineer at the US planemaker alleged the company took manufacturing shortcuts on its 787 Dreamliner aircraft in order to ease production bottlenecks of its most advanced airliner.\\n\\nMost Read from Bloomberg\\n\\nFactory workers wrongly measured and filled gaps that can occur when airframe segments of the 787 are joined together, according to Sam Salehpour, a longtime Boeing employee who made his concerns public on Tuesday. That assembly process could create “significant fatigue” in the composite material of the barrel sections and impair the structural integrity of more than 1,000 of the widebody jets in service, he said.\\n\\nADVERTISEMENT\\n\\nSalehpour, who according to his attorneys at Katz Banks Kumin LLP in Washington worked on the 787 from 2020 through early 2022, said the issues he described “may dramatically reduce the life of the plane.” Boeing disputes the allegations.\\n\\n“In a mad rush to reduce the backlog of the planes and get them to market, Boeing did not follow its own engineering requirements,” the engineer said on a conference call with reporters and his lawyers.\\n\\nThe claims risk opening another flank at the embattled planemaker, which is already facing intense scrutiny of its manufacturing and quality practices since a fuselage panel blew off a nearly new 737 Max 9 shortly after takeoff on Jan. 5. The allegations now extend the spotlight to the Dreamliner, a critical source of cash for Boeing as 737 output remains muted under close oversight by the US Federal Aviation Administration.\\n\\nAfter the allegations were made public, Senator Richard Blumenthal, a Connecticut Democrat, announced that he had asked Boeing’s departing Chief Executive Officer Dave Calhoun to appear at an April 17 subcommittee hearing called to examine the planemaker’s safety culture. Calhoun last month announced that he’s stepping down by the end of the year, part of a wider management shakeup in the wake of the Jan. 5 accident.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nHalted Deliveries\\n\\n“Boeing understands the important oversight responsibilities of the subcommittee and we are cooperating with this inquiry,” the company said, when asked if Calhoun or other executives planned to testify. “We have offered to provide documents, testimony and technical briefings, and are in discussions with the subcommittee regarding next steps.”\\n\\nIn separate statements, Boeing disputed Salehpour’s account. The company noted it had halted 787 deliveries for nearly two years earlier this decade under close FAA supervision after it found a spate of tiny structural imperfections in the joints where the carbon-fiber barrel sections are bolted together.\\n\\n“These claims about the structural integrity of the 787 are inaccurate and do not represent the comprehensive work Boeing has done to ensure the quality and long-term safety of the aircraft,” the planemaker said in a statement responding to the allegations, which were reported earlier Tuesday by the New York Times.\\n\\nCompany engineers are “completing exhaustive analysis to determine any long-term inspection and maintenance required, with oversight from the FAA,” Boeing said.\\n\\nThe latest allegations cast Boeing in an unfavorable light as it grapples with a crisis of confidence after the Jan. 5 panel blowout. While nobody on that flight was seriously hurt, the issue has put the spotlight on Boeing’s manufacturing and safety procedures and has led to a wholesale makeover of senior management. The crisis has jolted investors as well.\\n\\nBoeing shares fell 1.9% Tuesday, extending their decline to almost 32% this year, the worst performance on the Dow Jones Industrial Average.\\n\\nSenate Hearing\\n\\nSalehpour plans to discuss the manufacturing shortfalls he witnessed during the hearing before the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations scheduled for April 17.\\n\\nIn a March 19 letter to Calhoun, Blumenthal and Wisconsin’s Ron Johnson, the panel’s top-ranking Republican, asked for Boeing’s “immediate cooperation” with the panel’s review of Salehpour’s allegations.\\n\\nSalehpour’s attorneys flagged the issues to the FAA in a whistleblower letter dated Jan. 19. The agency has launched an investigation and interviewed Salehpour, his attorneys said, adding that other whistleblowers have come forward.\\n\\n“Voluntary reporting without fear of reprisal is a critical component in aviation safety,” the FAA said in a statement. “We strongly encourage everyone in the aviation industry to share information. We thoroughly investigate all reports.”\\n\\nBoeing disputed his attorney’s suggestion that in-service 787 Dreamliners face shorter commercial lives. The company said it has confirmed the finding through extensive fatigue testing, including forces that were more than 10 times the maximum allowed in production.\\n\\nSalehpour said he flagged his concerns to Boeing management but was ignored and ultimately transferred to the 777 program. There he claims to have also witnessed improper production practices after the planemaker ripped out a flawed robotic system without properly redesigning the relevant parts to match the new assembly process.\\n\\nIn a separate statement, Boeing said the claims were also inaccurate. “We are fully confident in the safety and durability of the 777 family,” the company said.\\n\\n(Adds whistleblower comment in fourth paragraph.)\\n\\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\\n\\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.', metadata={'title': 'Boeing Crisis of Confidence Deepens With 787 Now Under Scrutiny', 'link': 'https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/news/boeing-shares-fall-nyt-report-164509069.html', 'authors': ['Siddharth Philip', 'Julie Johnsson'], 'language': 'en', 'description': '(Bloomberg) -- Boeing Co. faces a deepening crisis of confidence after an engineer at the US planemaker alleged the company took manufacturing shortcuts on its 787 Dreamliner aircraft in order to ease production bottlenecks of its most advanced airliner.Most Read from BloombergUS Slams Strikes on Russia Oil Refineries as Risk to Oil MarketsChinese Cement Maker Halted After 99% Crash in 15 MinutesBond Trader Places Record Futures Bet on Eve of Inflation DataApple’s India iPhone Output Hits $14 Bi', 'publish_date': None}),\n",

    "## Dictionnary-based approach\n",
    "\n",
    "A dictionary-based approach is a simple way to perform sentiment analysis. It consists of using a list of words with associated sentiment scores. The sentiment score of a sentence is the sum of the sentiment scores of the words it contains. You can also normalize the score by the number of words in the sentence.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "For this type of approach, we will need to use a financial sentiment dictionary. I will use the Loughran-McDonald dictionary, which is widely used in finance. Note that this dictionary is designed for financial statements, so it may not be the best choice for news articles.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can download the dictionary from [here](https://sraf.nd.edu/loughranmcdonald-master-dictionary/) (direct link: [Loughran-McDonald_MasterDictionary_1993-2023.csv](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ptUgGVeeUGhCbaKL14Ri3Xi5xOKkPkUD/view?usp=sharing))\n",

    "\n",
    "### Pre-processing\n",
    "\n",
    "The preprocessing steps to use a dictionnary based approach depend on the dictionnary you are using and the final measure you want to obtain. In this case, we will use the Loughran-McDonald dictionary, which contains variation of similar words, including plural forms, verb forms, etc. Therefore, we do not need to perform stemming or lemmatization, a common step in text preprocessing.\n",
    "\n",
    "The preprocessing steps we will perform are:\n",
    "    - Lowercasing\n",
    "    - Removing punctuation\n",
    "    - Removing stopwords\n",
    "    - Removing numbers\n",
    "\n",
    "The removal of stopwords and numbers is optional, but it will affect the sentiment score of the text as measure as a ratio of the number of words in the text. Other common filtering includes removing URLs, emails, cities, company names, etc.\n",

    "## Bert-based models\n",
    "\n",
    "BERT-based models are often called \"state-of-the-art models\" in recent papers in the finance even if the original [Bert paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.04805) dates from 2018 and many more advanced models have come along since. They are pre-trained on a large corpus of text and fine-tuned on a specific task. In this case, we will use FinBert, a BERT model fine-tuned on financial data (see [FinBert paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.10063)).\n",
    "\n",
    "The way these models work is by taking a sequence of tokens as input and outputting a vector of size 768 (or 1024, depending on the model). This vector can be used as input to a classifier to predict the sentiment of the text. The FinBert model is trained to output softmax outputs (ie, probabilities) for three classes: positive, negative, and neutral.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Pre-processing\n",
    "\n",
    "You won't perform any pre-processing on the text before feeding it to the model. The model will take care of tokenizing the text and converting it to a sequence of tokens. Common pre-processing for Bert models include masking some words (date, company names, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Usage\n",
    "\n",
    "Many Bert models, including FinBert, are available in the Hugging Face Transformers library adn can be fecthed automatically.\n",
